# Bamazon
An app called Bamazon that will let you look through inventory, purchase items, and more!

### Overview!
This is how the application will work. The customer will be shown a table of products they can purchase. The table will include an item ID, the name of the product, the department the item belongs to, the price of the item, and the amount in stock.

As the customer purchases the items it will update the stock and the total of their order accordingly. Here is an example of how the app works!

### Out of stock!
If the customer is trying to buy more than what is in stock this is what will appear:
